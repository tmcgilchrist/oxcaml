   confusing, lossy, or missing demanglings. This test is a deliberate

(* {1 Classes and objects get poor symbols across the board}

   OxCaml emits no DWARF for the OOP fragment of OCaml and the linker
   names are correspondingly weak. Recording them here documents what
   future object support (Shape.t object variants, then DWARF
   [DW_TAG_class_type] / [DW_TAG_subprogram] / [DW_TAG_inheritance])
   would aim to fix.

   - Method bodies lose their name: every method below mangles to an
     anonymous [fn] -- mostly a bare top-level [E2e_suboptimal.fn],
     rarely as [<class>.fn] -- so methods are indistinguishable from
     each other, from the unrelated top-level [scale], and from
     ordinary anonymous functions.
   - Instance variables ([val nick], [val count]) and their accessors
     produce no symbol of their own.
   - A [virtual] class yields no constructor symbol, and [inherit]
     leaves no trace in any name.
   - An immediate object ([object ... end] with no class, in
     [make_logger]) loses even the name of the binding it is attached
     to. *)
