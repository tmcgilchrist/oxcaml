(* Cases where the structured name-mangling scheme currently produces
   confusing, lossy, or missing demanglings. This test is a deliberate
   record of that suboptimal output, not an endorsement of it: the
   reference is expected to improve as the scheme is refined. See the
   STRUCTURED column of [e2e_suboptimal.reference] for the demangled
   names. *)

(* {1 Nested anonymous functions accumulate a redundant location chain}

   Each [fun] is [@inline never] so every closure survives as its own
   symbol. The structured name records one [fn(file:line:col)] per
   enclosing anonymous function, even though a single location already
   identifies a closure uniquely. The deepest closure mangles to
   [...nested_lambdas.fn(..3:2).fn(..4:4).fn], and note that the leaf
   [fn] is the only one that drops its own location. *)
let nested_lambdas a =
  fun[@inline never] b ->
    fun[@inline never] c ->
      fun[@inline never] d -> a + b + c + d

(* {1 Functor instances are indistinguishable; the body name doubles}

   The two applications below produce two separate compiled copies of
   [run], but both mangle identically to [Make.run]: the application
   site ([Int_inst] / [Str_inst]) never appears in the name, so the
   copies cannot be told apart. The functor's own body symbol also
   doubles its name, mangling to [Make.Make]. *)
module type ORD = sig
  type t

  val cmp : t -> t -> int
end

module Make (O : ORD) = struct
  let[@inline never] run a b = O.cmp a b + O.cmp b a
end

module Int_inst = Make (struct
  type t = int

  let cmp = compare
end)

module Str_inst = Make (struct
  type t = string

  let cmp = compare
end)

(* {1 Anonymous first-class modules collapse to one name}

   The two distinct [(module struct ... end)] bodies both mangle to
   [pick.v]: the anonymous-module location that would tell them apart
   is not recorded for first-class modules. *)
module type V = sig
  val v : int -> int
end

let pick flag : (module V) =
  if flag
  then (module struct
    let[@inline never] v x = x + 1
  end)
  else
    (module struct
      let[@inline never] v x = x - 1
    end)

(* {1 Lazy thunks have no mangling path item}

   The body of a [lazy (...)] is lifted to its own closure but the
   scheme records no [lazy] path item for it, so it mangles to a bare
   top-level [fn] with no location: indistinguishable from any other
   anonymous function and giving no hint that it is a lazy thunk or
   where it came from. *)
let deferred () =
  let t = lazy (Sys.opaque_identity 41 + 1) in
  Lazy.force t

(* {1 Classes and objects get poor symbols across the board}

   OxCaml emits no DWARF for the OOP fragment of OCaml and the linker
   names are correspondingly weak. Recording them here documents what
   future object support (Shape.t object variants, then DWARF
   [DW_TAG_class_type] / [DW_TAG_subprogram] / [DW_TAG_inheritance])
   would aim to fix.

   - Method bodies lose their name: every method below mangles to an
     anonymous [fn] -- mostly a bare top-level [E2e_suboptimal.fn],
     rarely as [<class>.fn] -- so methods are indistinguishable from
     each other, from the unrelated top-level [scale], and from
     ordinary anonymous functions.
   - Instance variables ([val nick], [val count]) and their accessors
     produce no symbol of their own.
   - A [virtual] class yields no constructor symbol, and [inherit]
     leaves no trace in any name.
   - An immediate object ([object ... end] with no class, in
     [make_logger]) loses even the name of the binding it is attached
     to. *)
