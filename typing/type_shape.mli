     declarations allocate new runtime objects that we would then have to find
     and display in the debugger. The flow for extension constructors is very
     different from regular type shapes. For now, we only support constructing
     shapes that Merlin understands. They should not end up in the shape
     reduction for DWARF emission at the moment. *)

(** [Evaluated_shape.unfold_and_evaluate] performs call-by-value evaluation of
    shapes. It should be applied after [reduce] (from [shape_reduce.ml]) has
    already been used. More specifically, when producing a type shape with
    [of_type_expr], the resulting shape is not a normal form. A normal form---at
    least for the emission into DWARF debug information---should no longer
    contain structures (from modules), lambdas (from functors and parametric
    types), application (from functor instantiation and type application),
    mutually recursive declarations and their projections ([Constr] and
    [Proj_decl]). (Due to missing information, it might still contain
    compilation units [Comp_unit] and projections [Proj] from them.)

    We reach the normal form of a type shape (e.g., during the emission of DWARF
    information) in two steps:

    + We execute [shape_reduce], which will substitute compilation units with
      their shapes loaded from .cms files and then reduce away projections
      [Proj] and functor applications. It will also, partially, deal with
      instantiation of type variables. That is, [of_type_declaration] inserts
      lambdas for non-recursive types with type arguments. These are reduced
      away via [shape_reduce]. (For (mutually-)recursive types, the next step
      handles the instantiation.)

    + After shape reduction, the type declaration can still contain recursive or
      mutually-recursive declarations, which have not been unfolded. Since we
      cannot directly emit these into DWARF, we then unfold recursive
      declarations applied to type shape arguments into recursive types with
      [Evaluated_shape.unfold_and_evaluate]. For example,
      [type 'a list = [] | :: of 'a * 'a list] applied to [int] becomes the type
      shape [Mu (Variant [] | :: of int * #0)]. *)
