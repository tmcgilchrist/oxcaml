     is still preserved if we include non-hex characters (i.e., [[g-z]]). *)

(** Encode an arbitrary string into the output character set (ie [[0-9A-Za-z_]],
    see {!is_out_char} for more details)

    The encoded string is composed of:
    - an optional [u], which is a flag indicating how the payload is encoded
      ([u] stands for {i universal} or {i Unicode}, as it allows any string of
      bytes to be encoded),
    - a decimal integer, which is the length of the following component,
    - the payload.

    If the original string contains only output characters and does not start
    with a digit, the payload is the original string as is and the optional [u]
    is absent.

    Otherwise, the encoded string will start by [u]. The payload is computed by
    first decomposing the original string into the subsequence of its output
    characters and its non-output characters, and then by concatenating:
    {ul
    {- for each chunk of consecutive non-output characters:
      - encode its relative insertion position as a base-26 number (see
        {!base26}),
      - encode every character in that chunk by the hexadecimal code of each byte,
        using lowercase letters (ie [[0-9a-f]], see {!hex}),}
    {- the separator character [_],}
    {- the string of output characters.}}

    Note that the choices of using decimal integers for the length, base-26
    numbers for the insertion positions and lowercase hexadecimal for bytes
    means that no explicit separator is required, it's never ambiguous.

    {2 Some examples}

    - [Structured_mangling] is composed only of output characters and starts
      with a letter (not a digit) so its payload is the original string and its
      full encoding with a space to increase legibility is
      [19 Structured_mangling].
    - [>>=] contains only non-output characters, so it is decomposed into the
      empty string (of output characters) and the sequence of consecutive
      characters [>>=] (so, in hexadecimal [3e 3e 3d]) that should be inserted
      at position 0 (so, in base-26 [A]); its full encoding is [u 8 A 3e3e3d _],
      again with spaces to increase legibility.
    - [let*] is decomposed into [let], and [*] (so [2a]) to insert at position 3
      (so [D]) in [let]; its full encoding is [u 7 D 2a _ let].
    - [func'sub'] is decomposed into [funcsub], ['] (so [27]) to insert at
      position 4 (so [E]) and a second ['] to insert at relative position 3 (the
      length of [sub], so [D]); its full encoding is then
      [u 14 E 27 D 27 _ funcsub].

(** [require_escaping str] is [true] iff (a) [str] contains a non-output
    character or (b) it starts with a digit. The latter is important to ensure
    that the encoded string can be non-ambiguously appended to the decimal
    integer representing its length in the mangling scheme.

    While not very common, identifiers that start with a digit can happen for
    anonymous modules and functions from a file whose name starts with a digit.
    For those, the compiler emits a warning but tolerates them. *)
