(** Structured name mangling for OxCaml symbols.

    This module implements a mangling scheme that encodes OCaml identifiers into
    a restricted character set (ASCII alphanumeric and underscore) suitable for
    use in linker symbols. The scheme preserves the lexical structure of the
    source program by encoding each scope (compilation unit, module, function,
    etc.) as a tagged path item.

    {2 Mangled symbol format}

    A mangled symbol has the form [_Caml<path>] where [<path>] is a sequence of
    tagged, length-prefixed identifiers:
    - [U] - compilation Unit
    - [M] - Module
    - [S] - anonymous Struct
    - [O] - class (O for object)
    - [F] - Function
    - [L] - anonymous function (L for lambda)
    - [P] - Partial application

    For example, [Foo.Bar.baz] in compilation unit [Foo] mangles to
    [_CamlU3FooM3BarF3baz]. *)

(** A path item represents a single lexical scope in the mangling path. *)
type path_item =
  | Compilation_unit of string  (** A compilation unit (file) *)
  | Module of string  (** A named module *)
  | Anonymous_module of int * int * string option
      (** [struct ... end] at (line, col, file) *)
  | Class of string  (** A class definition *)
  | Function of string  (** A named function *)
  | Anonymous_function of int * int * string option
      (** [fun ... -> ...] at (line, col, file) *)
  | Partial_function of int * int * string option
      (** A partial application at (line, col, file) *)

(** A mangling path is a list of path items representing the full lexical
    context of an identifier. *)
type path = path_item list

(** Construct a mangling path from a compilation unit. *)
val path_from_comp_unit : Compilation_unit.t -> path

(** Transform a {!Compilation_unit.t} and a {!path} into a mangled name suitable
    for creating a {!LinkageName.t} *)
val mangle_ident : Compilation_unit.t -> path -> string
