(** Structured name mangling for OxCaml symbols.

    This module implements a mangling scheme that encodes OxCaml identifiers
    into a restricted character set (ASCII alphanumeric and underscore) suitable
    for use in linker symbols. The scheme preserves the lexical structure of the
    source program by encoding each scope (compilation unit, module, function,
    etc.) as a tagged path item.

    {2 Mangled symbol format}

    A mangled symbol has the form [_Caml<path>] where [<path>] is a sequence of
    tagged, length-prefixed identifiers:
    - [U] - compilation Unit
    - [I] - Inline marker
    - [M] - Module
    - [S] - anonymous Struct
    - [O] - class (O for object)
    - [F] - Function
    - [L] - anonymous function (L for lambda)
    - [P] - Partial application

    For example, [Foo.Bar.baz] in compilation unit [Foo] mangles to
    [_CamlU3FooM3BarF3baz]. *)

(** A path item represents a single lexical scope in the mangling path. *)
type 'cu path_item =
  | Compilation_unit of 'cu  (** A compilation unit (file) *)
  | Inline_marker
      (** A separator (between destination and source) to track inlining *)
  | Module of string  (** A named module *)
  | Anonymous_module of int * int * string option
      (** [struct ... end] at (line, col, file) *)
  | Class of string  (** A class definition *)
  | Function of string  (** A named function *)
  | Anonymous_function of int * int * string option
      (** [fun ... -> ...] at (line, col, file) *)
  | Partial_function of int * int * string option
      (** A partial application at (line, col, file) *)

(* CR sspies: Support for lazy expressions (they do not appear in the mangling
   path at all) and object methods (they appear as regular functions) is still
   missing; adding a construct for lazy expressions would allow us to make sure
   there is always a mangling path item for every [Debuginfo] scope *)

(** A mangling path is a list of path items representing the full lexical
    context of an identifier. *)
type 'cu path = 'cu path_item list

(** Transform a {!Compilation_unit.t} and a {!path} into a mangled name suitable
    for creating a {!LinkageName.t} *)
val mangle_ident : Compilation_unit.t -> Compilation_unit.t path -> string

(** [encode buf str] appends the encoding of [str] into [buf] as a
    length-prefixed identifier.

    This function is exposed just for testing uses *)
val encode : Buffer.t -> string -> unit

(** Inverse direction: parse a mangled symbol back into a structured path. *)
module Parse : sig
  (** [starts_with_prefix sym] is [true] iff [sym] starts with one of the
      prefixes the structured mangler emits ([_Caml] or its macOS-flavoured
      [__Caml] variant). *)
  val starts_with_prefix : string -> bool

  (** [parse sym] returns the structured path encoded by [sym] together with any
      trailing suffix (e.g. [_<n>] ids appended by the compiler after the
      mangled path). Returns [None] if [sym] is not a valid structured mangled
      symbol. *)
  val parse : string -> (string path * string) option

  (** [decode str pos] reverse {!encode}: decode a single length-prefixed
      identifier at [pos] in [str], returning the decoded string and the number
      of bytes consumed.

      This function is exposed just for testing uses *)
  val decode : string -> int -> (string * int) option
